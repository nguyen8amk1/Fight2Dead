TODAY: 
    FIX THE CAMERA (2h) []
        currently what's the camera can do: 
            can somewhat (linear) zoom in and zoom out to show the 2 players 

        what the camera need to have
            better zooming -> log zoom (more zoom in when far and less zoom in when close)
            better frameming (not show the blue part)


    CLIENT SEND LOGIN/REGISTER DATA TO SERVER (2h) [X] 
	the connection diagram: 
		client -> (client API) -> server -> (DAO) -> database
        what's the server actually offer to the client: 
            register a new account 
            login to an account  
                checking if the account is valid 

    PUSH THE SERVER TO VPS (2h) [] - before that MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS FINE IN THE LOCAL FIRST 
        what potential problems need to be address ??: (creating and quitting the game problems)
        check if multiple rooms and be created simunatioulys 
        and room quitting when player quit not in order have any problems


    ADD 4 PLAYER MODE (6h) [] 
        CLIENT: 
            change the lobby -> now we have 4 people (4 lines) @DONE [X]

            change the choose map -> @CURRENT (1h) []
                currently each people choose a map, but should they :v 
                so only 1 map, the person who choose the faster get's it :v  (apply for both mode)
            
            change the choose character -> (3h) []
                choose character in 2v2 problems: 
                    a player can only choose 1 character 
                    Solution: 
                        show the character whenever it showed (DO THIS WAY) (live showing the chosen characters)
                            -> p1 and p3 choose first then p2 and p4 -> can keep the sliding animation 
                            -> currently we don't have this scene done yet, so first stick with the 1 character chose way 

                    CURRENT PROBLEMS (TODO): 
                        WHAT I ACTUALLY HAPPEN:
                            1v1: 
                                each player choose 2 characters  
                                vd: if player id = 1 -> choose char 1 then stay on the left 
                                                        choose char 2 then transition to the left corner 

                                    if player id = 2 -> choose char 3 then stay on the right
                                                     -> choose char 4 then transition to the right corner 
                            2v2: 
                                each player choose 1 character 
                                vd: if player id = 1 -> choose char 1 then stay on the left 
                                    if player id = 2 -> choose char 2 then transition to the left corner 
                                    if player id = 3 -> choose char 3 then stay on the right 
                                    if player id = 4 -> choose char 4 then transition to the right corner 

                        the choosing character only shows in 2 player screen instead of 4 
                        and each of them choose 2
                            -> make each choose 4
                        -> update the chosen character with the others
