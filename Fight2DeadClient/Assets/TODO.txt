TODAY: 
	FIX THE TRANSFORM PROBLEM AS WELL (2h) []
		THE TRANSFORM COMPLETELY NOT WORKING ON GLOBAL [X] (2h) 

		TRANSFORM KINDA WORKS ON LAN MODE (2h) [X] -> not completely though 

		THE MOVING OF THE CHARACTER IN THE BEGINNING IS NOT GOOD () []

	KIP KO ?? 

	LET'S SEE HOW EVERYTHING SHOULD WORKS ?
		the same set of keys to control 
		2players: 
			-> attach control script into player dynamically 

			if on player1 window -> player 1 move 
			if on player2 window -> player 2 move 

		4players: 

	IF CHOOSE THE SAME CHARACTER ON THEN THE CAMERA IS FLICKERING SINCE THERE ARE ONLY ONE CHARACTER ON THE SCREEN  

	4 PLAYER MODE HAVE TO BE PLAYABLE (2h) []
		-> decide how 4 player control works ?  (player switch and stuff like that)


	QUIT MESSAGE AND HANDLE ROOM EXIT PROPERLY (2H) [X] -> @temporary done :v 
		-> how server should response to quit event of client ?? 
		-> how client should repsonse to quit event of them or other players quit ?? 

		when could a player exit the game:  
			after they finish a match -> send tcp message to quit and remove them from room 


			*ONLY HANDLE THE GLOBAL FOR THE MOMENT 
			
			WHAT HAPPPENED TO THE SERVER WHEN CLOSE THE GAME RIGHT NOW ? 
				*currently nothing happen when close in the global 

			-> works on global first (1h) 
				-> send tcp message when close the game 
			-> then LAN (1h)
