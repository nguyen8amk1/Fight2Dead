TODAY: 
	LET'S UPDATE THE GAME CONTROL FIRST -> 2 players [X]

	SEND TRANSFORM INFO TO THE OTHER PLAYER AS WELL -> whose turn to control the game 
		how 2 player character transition should work ??  updating the state between the 2 is hard [X]
		how 4 player control should works ?? 
			only 1 person (in each team) can control at one time 

	GLOBAL MODE: 
		LAG WHEN PLAYING IN GLOBAL MODE, -> lerp between position (2h) []
		OFTEN GET STUCK -> make the loop keep running (2h) []
		FIX THESE ASAP 
		-> tong cong 8 tieng dong ho 

	MAKE THE LAN MODE TRULY WORKS [], can play on different computers (2h) []
		-> these 2 should be done today

	-> HAVE TO DONE TOMORROW


	OPENSLL ENCRYPTION []
	-> the other day

	DATABASE encryption password ?? 

	KIP KO ?? 





	LET'S SEE HOW EVERYTHING SHOULD WORKS ?
		the same set of keys to control 
		2players: 
			-> attach control script into player dynamically 

			if on player1 window -> player 1 move 
			if on player2 window -> player 2 move 

		4players: 

	IF CHOOSE THE SAME CHARACTER ON THEN THE CAMERA IS FLICKERING SINCE THERE ARE ONLY ONE CHARACTER ON THE SCREEN  

	4 PLAYER MODE HAVE TO BE PLAYABLE (2h) []
		-> decide how 4 player control works ?  (player switch and stuff like that)


	QUIT MESSAGE AND HANDLE ROOM EXIT PROPERLY (2H) [X] -> @temporary done :v 
		-> how server should response to quit event of client ?? 
		-> how client should repsonse to quit event of them or other players quit ?? 

		when could a player exit the game:  
			after they finish a match -> send tcp message to quit and remove them from room 


			*ONLY HANDLE THE GLOBAL FOR THE MOMENT 
			
			WHAT HAPPPENED TO THE SERVER WHEN CLOSE THE GAME RIGHT NOW ? 
				*currently nothing happen when close in the global 

			-> works on global first (1h) 
				-> send tcp message when close the game 
			-> then LAN (1h) 

	-> DONE ALL TODAY -> 8 hours of work 

	MAKE THE LAN MODE TRULY WORKS [], can play on different computers (2h) []
	-> these 2 should be done today

	OPENSLL ENCRYPTION []
	-> the other day

	have 2 days left
